The goal of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a science is to make
<br>
machines do things that would require intelligence if done by humans.
<br>
Therefore, the answer to the question Can Machines Think?
was vitally important to the discipline.
<br>
The answer is not a simple “Yes” or “No”.
<br>Some people are smarter in some ways than others.
Sometimes we make very intelligent decisions <br>but sometimes we
also make very silly mistakes.
<br>Therefore, we should expect that if machines can think<br>, some of
them might be smarter than others in some ways.
